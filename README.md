# Monokini — Parametric Cable-Channel System

**Monokini** is an [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) parametric library for generating 3D-printable cable-management channels. Every part snaps together using the *Monokini* profile and is fully customisable through the built-in OpenSCAD Customizer.

## Quick Start

1. Install OpenSCAD and the BOSL2 library (see [Requirements](#requirements)).
2. Open any `.scad` file in OpenSCAD.
3. Open the **Customizer** panel (`Window › Customizer`).
4. Adjust the parameters to fit your installation and click **Render** (`F6`).
5. Export as STL (`File › Export › Export as STL…`) and slice with your preferred slicer.

> **Tip — Multi-colour labels:** Labels only work on MakerWorld. Export as 3MF and import into your slicer as a project (not as geometry).

## Customizer Parameters

All files share a common set of parameter groups.

### Channel Size
| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `Channel_Width_in_Units` | Width (X axis) in grid units (1 unit = 28 mm by default) |
| `Channel_Total_Height` | Total height including the connector base (Z axis, in mm) |
| `Channel_Length_Units` | Length (Y axis) in grid units |

### Cord Cutouts
| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `Number_of_Cord_Cutouts` | How many cutouts to add along the channel |
| `Cord_Side_Cutouts` | Which side(s) to cut: `Left Side`, `Right Side`, `Both Sides`, `None`, `Left Side Top`, `Right Side Top` |
| `Cord_Cutout_Width` | Width of each cutout (mm) |
| `Distance_Between_Cutouts` | Spacing between cutouts (mm) |
| `Shift_Cutouts_Forward_or_Back` | Y-axis offset for cutout placement (mm) |

### Text Label
| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `Add_Label` | Enable/disable the text label |
| `Text` | String to display |
| `Font` | Font name (must be installed locally when using OpenSCAD offline) |
| `Font_Style` | Style variant (e.g. `Bold`, `Italic`) |
| `Text_size` | Font size (mm) |
| `Text_Depth` | Depth of emboss/deboss (mm, increments of 0.2 recommended) |
| `Text_Color` | Preview colour of the label text |
| `Text_Emboss` | `true` = text stands proud; `false` = text is recessed |

### Advanced Options
| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `Global_Color` | Preview colour of the part body |
| `Suppress_Connectors` | Suppression key per channel segment: `N` = none, `L` = suppress left, `R` = suppress right, `B` = suppress both, `S` = static (no flaring). Separate multiple entries with commas |
| `Decorative` | When `true`, produces a solid decorative profile without functional connectors |
| `Grip_Flare` | Flare angle (degrees) applied to the snap-grip connector |
